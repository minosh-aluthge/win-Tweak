### 3. Check Antivirus Settings
Some antivirus software may flag batch scripts:

3. **Verify contents**:
   - `Win-Tweak.bat` (main script)
   - `README.md` (documentation)
   - `LICENSE` (license file)

### Step 2: Verify File Integrity
1. **Check file size**: Win-Tweak.bat should be approximately 15-20KB
2. **Scan for malware**: Run a full antivirus scan on the folder
3. **Verify digital signature**: Check if the file has a valid signature

### Step 3: Initial Setup
1. **Right-click** on `Win-Tweak.bat`

============================================================================
                   Win-Tweak: Windows Tweaker & Backup Tool
============================================================================

Please choose an option:

  [1] Create a System Restore Point ONLY
  [2] Apply System Optimizations & Tweaks (creates restore point first)
  [3] Install Visual C++ Runtimes (Guided Download)
  [4] Perform a FULL Registry Backup ONLY
  [5] ALL: Backup, Restore Point, THEN Optimizations
  [6] Restore Default Windows Settings
  [7] Exit
```

### Step 3: Recommended First Steps
For first-time users, we recommend this sequence:

1. **Choose Option [1]**: Create a System Restore Point
2. **Choose Option [4]**: Perform a Full Registry Backup
3. **Choose Option [2]**: Apply Standard Optimizations (not Aggressive)

## üîß Configuration Options

### Standard vs Aggressive Mode
When selecting Option [2], you'll choose optimization level:

#### Standard Optimizations (Recommended)
- **Safe for most systems**
- **Balanced performance improvements**
- **Easily reversible changes**
- **Minimal risk of system issues**

#### Aggressive Optimizations (Advanced Users)
- **Maximum performance gains**
- **Designed for low-end PCs**
- **More extensive system changes**
- **Requires careful consideration**

### Interactive Prompts
Win-Tweak uses interactive Y/N prompts for each tweak:

- **Read each prompt carefully**
- **Type 'Y' to apply the tweak**
- **Type 'N' to skip the tweak**
- **Take your time to decide**

## üìÅ File Organization

After installation and first use, your folder structure should look like:

```
