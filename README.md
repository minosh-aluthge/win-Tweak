## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 operating system
- Administrator privileges (script auto-elevates)
- Internet connection (for Visual C++ runtime download)

### Running the Script
1. **Download**: Save the script file to your preferred location
2. **Execute**: Double-click `Win-Tweak.bat` or run from command prompt
3. **Elevation**: Allow administrator privileges when prompted
4. **Navigate**: Use the numbered menu system to select operations
5. **Follow Prompts**: Answer Y/N questions based on your preferences

### Safety Recommendations
1. **Always create a restore point** before applying tweaks
2. **Read each prompt carefully** - some changes are irreversible
3. **Start with Standard optimizations** before trying Aggressive mode
4. **Keep backup files** until you're satisfied with changes
5. **Test system stability** after applying optimizations

### Restoration Process
